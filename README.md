# 23_research

Research project for the Murthy Lab during Summer 2023. Models of gamma oscillation bands found in the mouse olfactory bulb, based on a 1989 model. Expanded model through additional parameters in cortical input (constant), amplitude of the input through olfactory receptors, and mitral/granule connectivity patterns..

Plot is found in `figures/` with additional specifications for which parameters have been changed found in the directory `README`.
