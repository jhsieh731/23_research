All folders are labeled O[x]_C[y] according to these models:
## Odor models
- x = 1a: uniform input, max amplitude 0.2
- x = 1b: uniform input, binomial `p =[0.5, 0.7]` to determine whether mitral cell receives input
- x = 2: latent input, all same slope and amplitude
- x = 3: latent response with same slope, synchronized exhale at 200ms
- x = 4: latent response with variable slope, synchronized exhale at 200ms

## Connectivity models
- y = 1: sample ring matrices from 1989 Li/Hopfield paper
- y = 2: hybrid model [not yet implemented]
- y = 3: uniform random model
    - y = 3i: 0.5-scaled uniform random model
    - y = 3ii: 2-scaled uniform random model
